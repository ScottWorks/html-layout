				I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from
				narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the
				storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
				Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go
				back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities,
				knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.
				<br>
				<br> Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
				<br>
				<br> And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted
				in the American dream.
				<br>
				<br> I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths
				to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
				<br>
				<br>
